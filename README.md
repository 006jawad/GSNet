# GSNet

## GSNet-based web application
This is a follow-up to my undergraduate thesis and our future journal manuscript, which involves GSNet, our proposed glioma segmentation network. 
We compacted the complete pipeline in an easy-to-use Web-based Application (Web App) to use the GSNet model as a medical imaging tool. This Web App accepts 3D MRI pictures in '.nii' file format as input. With FLAIR, t1, t1ce, and t2 MRI scans as input, our Web App can generate the corresponding segmentation masks for the Whole Tumor, Tumor Core, and Enhancing Tumor regions in 20 seconds and save them locally in '.nii' file format.

The results are generated by the Web App and saved in any local folder. The related signal appears on the next page of the Web App. We used the freeware ITK-SNAP to display the stored outputs. Because of its small size, the Web App generates segmentation masks within a short period. This Web App's weight file is around 24.7 MB. The outputs, which are saved as '.nii' files, are around 8 MB apiece, for a total of 24 MB (3 outputs for three distinct locations).
